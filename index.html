      <hr />
      <h3>2024 | TECHNICAL AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGENT IN TELEPERFORMANCE</h3>
      Part of a quite technical and diverse (in its support needs) project. Was trained in various
      forms of support and of course, primarily, through the usage of soft skills, navigated that
      realm with the priority being the assistance of a user and the resolution of any and all
      issues and/or questions they might have had.
      <hr />
      <h3>2022 | FREELANCER TRANSLATOR FOR THE PUBLISHING HOUSE ANUBIS</h3>
      Part of the translating team (English to Greek) for the publishing house "Anubis".
      Specifically worked on the title "THE DC COMICS ENCYCLOPEDIA NEW EDITION",
      making sure that the translation provided matched the style and tone of each and every
      other member of the team while making sure that it adhered to the original content,
      elevating it and maintaining its nuances.
      Provided correction services towards the publishing house "Anubis" in the same venture,
      given that the source material for the translation had inconsistencies that surfaced
      through the translation process and were later addressed appropriately.
      <hr />
      <h3>2018-2021 | NARRATIVE LEAD IN THE ONLINE COMMUNITY ::JEDI::</h3>
      Member of the online community and, at the same time, roleplaying game ::JEDI::.
      Reached the highest level of administrative duties within the community which included
      (yet were not limited to):
      <ul type="none">
      <li>• Management of a community of approximately 50 members. •</li>
      <li>• Quality and Creative Story Control as well as of the Tools available to the
      community. •</li>
      <li>• Writing of Stories and Narratives with the purpose of evolving and adding
      to the complexity of the members themselves. •</li>
      <li>• Writing of Stories and Narratives with the purpose of enriching the community
      as a whole. •</li>
      <li>• Creation of 3D Models, as well as of other various assets, for the purpose of
      them being utilized within various Narratives. •</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>2015-2023 | FREELANCER TRANSLATOR IN THE ONLINE COMMUNITY ::JEDI::</h3>
      Translation of content from Greek to English, as a freelancer, with the purpose of the
      content's utilization by Greek members of the community lacking the necessary English
      comprehension or expression capability. For the duration of the project, the frequency of
      the requested translations has been on a daily basis with the complexity of the content
      varying depending on the customer's grammatical level.Frequently, within the provision of
      such services, there was the offer of enriching the content in question (all while, of course,
      making sure that the content's significance, meaning and nuances remained intact.)
      Beyond the translations within the community in question, I provided text correction
      services either towards the administrative staff of the community (before I became a
      part of it) or towards the members of the community whose skills allowed them to a
      certain degree to write in English while they lacked the knowledge to utilize it in an
      appropriate manner.
